# AppleFrenzy

An iteration on the [Apple Picker Prototype](https://github.com/Shaman37/Prototype-Apple_Picker). 

The game consists on 3 different colored barrels: green, red and golden.

From time to time, apples with different colors will fall from the top of the screen, and should be picked up by the barrel with the corresponding color.
